V4L2-GFX
========
This is a Linux kernel module which implements a V4L2 video capture interface
and also interfaces with OMAP SGX kernel services so GL applications can
stream textures originating from V4L2 clients for e.g. an appropriate
GStreamer setup.

Build Pre-requisities (Linux)
-----------------------------
First it's advisable to get access to a suitable OS environment. For the
community at large the best place is probably Pandaboard.org. Other TI
customers/partners may be working with the so called 'L24' releases.

For builds on Linux you need access to the SGX kernel services DDK, there is a
GPL version of this I believe. The DDK should contain the right headers and
you will also need to build the kernel services also in order to link against
the module symbols. You will need to get access to the SGX user side binaries
in order to have a working SGX setup though - these should be available as
part of the OS environment mentioned earlier.

Build (Linux)
-------------
Checkout the instructions in the file "ddk/kbuild/Makefile" to integrate
this driver against the SGX kernel services. It will then build

Note that the PVR kernel services may need to be patched to support
an additional 'device':

See the platform file 'sysinfo.h'

-#define SYS_DEVICE_COUNT 3
+#define SYS_DEVICE_COUNT 4

Build (Android)
---------------
In Android OMAP kernel trees the PVR kernel services are part of the kernel
rather than being in a seperate DDK (as Linux).

The patch 0002-Patch-Android-Linux-kernel-to-enable-the-V4L2-GFX.patch
describes how to patch the kernel to support this driver.
