V4L2-GFX
========
This is a Linux kernel module which implements a V4L2 video capture interface
and also interfaces with OMAP SGX kernel services so GL applications can
stream textures originating from V4L2 clients for e.g. an appropriate
GStreamer setup.

Build Pre-requisities (Linux)
-----------------------------
For builds on Linux you need access to the SGX kernel services DDK, there is a
GPL version which should contain the right headers and you will also need to 
build the kernel services also, in order to link against the module symbols.
